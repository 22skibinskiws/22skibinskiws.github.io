### CPSC 120
 
* Lab 9
 
   Lab 9, part 2 was one of my favorite labs this semester because it gave me some idea of how spellcheck works. It was also one of the first times I had used an input file or output file in my time coding. Lab 9, part 2 was difficult to figure out in some parts but when it finally worked and all of the words that were misspelled printed it was very satisfying. I learned more about how IOStream works and how to take the information that comes from a file and use it in code. We had previously learned how IOStream works but this lab was the first time that we used the information given by the file to do something with code. I use spell check everyday and to get a small glimpse into how it actually works was very interesting to me.
 
* Lab 8
 
   Lab 8, part 3 was one of my favorite labs this semester because of the animations it played. Although I felt this lab was fairly straightforward and simple, I was having some problems with this specific part because of a small mistake in the code. Once I figured it out and fixed it I was able to play the animations. This was the first time I had ever used the iostream function in c++ and I am glad that I learned that from this lab. IOStream seems like a very important function for coding and learning it also seems very important. Even though I did not make these animations they were still very cool and the animations combined with finally figuring out what was wrong with my code made for a very memorable moment in this class.
 
* Lab 12
 
   Lab 12, part 1 was definitely my favorite part of this class for a few reasons but mainly getting to see the animation that we made with the code. First off, lab 12 had to be one of my favorites because it was the last lab and I had finally realized that all of my hard work had paid off. Also the lab was straight forward and I found it to be easier than a few other labs this semester. I learned how to use GraphicMagick in this lab to create animations and not just pictures like we had done previously. The animation that was made by the code was also very cool and I felt a feeling of accomplishment from both finishing the class and making such a cool thing by coding. This lab was one of the most memorable times that I actually felt accomplished by what I was coding.
